IMDB-Movies Data Analysis

Project Overview
In this project we will be analyzing data about movies from the IMDB website (https://www.themoviedb.org/). We will be interested in finding trends related to the revenue of movies and what could affect it. Then we are going to take a look at the runtime of the movies and how it changed from year to year.

Each row of the data set contains a movie entry and the columns include properties of that movie, like: homepage, id, original_title, overview, popularity, release_date...etc.

In this project I will explore the following questions:

    1. What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
    2. Which genres are most popular from year to year?
